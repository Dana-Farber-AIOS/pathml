# Installation

There are several ways to install `PathML`:

1. pip install
2. clone repo to local machine and install from source

Options (1) and (2) require that you first install all external dependencies:
* openslide
* JDK 8

We recommend using conda for environment management. 
Download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

*Note: these instructions are for Linux. Commands may be different for other platforms.*

## Installation option 1: pip install

Create conda environment
````
conda create --name pathml python=3.8 numpy=1.18.5
conda activate pathml
````

Install external dependencies
````
sudo apt-get install openslide-tools g++ gcc libblas-dev liblapack-dev
````

Install [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.java.net/)
````
conda install openjdk==8.0.152
````

Optionally install CUDA (instructions [here](#CUDA))

Install `PathML`
````
pip install pathml
````

## Installation option 2: clone repo and install from source

Clone repo
````
git clone https://github.com/Dana-Farber-AIOS/pathml.git
cd pathml
````

Create conda environment
````
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pathml
````

Optionally install CUDA (instructions [here](#CUDA))

Install PathML: 
````
pip install -e .
````


## CUDA

To use GPU acceleration for model training or other tasks, you must install CUDA. 
This guide should work, but for the most up-to-date instructions, refer to the [official PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Check the version of CUDA:
````
nvidia-smi
````

Install correct version of `cudatoolkit`:
````
# update this command with your CUDA version number
conda install cudatoolkit=11.0
````

After installing PyTorch, optionally verify successful PyTorch installation with CUDA support: 
````
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
````
