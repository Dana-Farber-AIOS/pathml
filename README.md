‚≠ê **PathML objective is to lower the barrier to entry to digital pathology**

Imaging datasets in cancer research are growing exponentially in both quantity and information density. These massive datasets may enable derivation of insights for cancer research and clinical care, but only if researchers are equipped with the tools to leverage advanced computational analysis approaches such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this work, we highlight three themes to guide development of such computational tools: scalability, standardization, and ease of use. We then apply these principles to develop PathML, a general-purpose research toolkit for computational pathology. We describe the design of the PathML framework and demonstrate applications in diverse use cases. 

üöÄ **The fastest way to get started?**

    docker pull pathml/pathml && docker run -it -p 8888:8888 pathml/pathml

:construction: the `dev` branch is under active development, with experimental features, bug fixes, and refactors that may happen at any time! 
Stable versions are available as tagged releases on GitHub, or as versioned releases on PyPI

# Installation

There are several ways to install `PathML`:

1. `pip install` from PyPI (**recommended for users**)
2. Clone repo to local machine and install from source (recommended for developers/contributors)
3. Use the PathML Docker container

Options (1) and (2) require that you first install all external dependencies:
* openslide
* JDK 8

We recommend using conda for environment management. 
Download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

*Note: these instructions are for Linux. Commands may be different for other platforms.*

## Installation option 1: pip install

Create conda environment:
````
conda create --name pathml python=3.8
conda activate pathml
````

Install external dependencies (Linux) with [Apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management):
````
sudo apt-get install openslide-tools g++ gcc libblas-dev liblapack-dev
````

Install external dependencies (MacOS) with [Brew](www.brew.sh):
````
brew install openslide
````

Install [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.java.net/):
````
conda install openjdk==8.0.152
````

Optionally install CUDA (instructions [here](#CUDA))

Install `PathML` from PyPI:
````
pip install pathml
````

## Installation option 2: clone repo and install from source

Clone repo:
````
git clone https://github.com/Dana-Farber-AIOS/pathml.git
cd pathml
````

Create conda environment:
````
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pathml
````

Optionally install CUDA (instructions [here](#CUDA))

Install `PathML` from source: 
````
pip install -e .
````

## Installation option 3: Docker

First, download or build the PathML Docker container:

![pathml-docker-installation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25375373/191053363-477497a1-9804-48f3-91f9-767dc7f859ed.gif)

- Option A: download PathML container from Docker Hub
   ````
   docker pull pathml/pathml:latest
   ````
  Optionally specify a tag for a particular version, e.g. `docker pull pathml/pathml:2.0.2`. To view possible tags, 
  please refer to the [PathML DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/pathml/pathml).
  
- Option B: build docker container from source
   ````
   git clone https://github.com/Dana-Farber-AIOS/pathml.git
   cd pathml
   docker build -t pathml/pathml .
   ````

Then connect to the container:
````
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 pathml/pathml
````

The above command runs the container, which is configured to spin up a jupyter lab session and expose it on port 8888. 
The terminal should display a URL to the jupyter lab session starting with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<.....>`. 
Navigate to that page and you should connect to the jupyter lab session running on the container with the pathml 
environment fully configured. If a password is requested, copy the string of characters following the `token=` in the 
url.

Note that the docker container requires extra configurations to use with GPU.  
Note that these instructions assume that there are no other processes using port 8888.

Please refer to the `Docker run` [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for further instructions
on accessing the container, e.g. for mounting volumes to access files on a local machine from within the container.

## Option 4: Google Colab

To get PathML running in a Colab environment:

````
!pip install openslide-python
!apt-get install openslide-tools
!apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null
os.environ["JAVA_HOME"] = "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
!update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java
!java -version
!pip install pathml
````

*Thanks to all of our open-source collaborators for helping maintain these installation instructions!*  
*Please open an issue for any bugs or other problems during installation process.*

## CUDA

To use GPU acceleration for model training or other tasks, you must install CUDA. 
This guide should work, but for the most up-to-date instructions, refer to the [official PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Check the version of CUDA:
````
nvidia-smi
````

Install correct version of `cudatoolkit`:
````
# update this command with your CUDA version number
conda install cudatoolkit=11.0
````

After installing PyTorch, optionally verify successful PyTorch installation with CUDA support: 
````
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
````

# Using with Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks are a convenient way to work interactively. To use `PathML` in Jupyter notebooks: 

## Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

PathML relies on Java to enable support for reading a wide range of file formats.
Before using `PathML` in Jupyter, you may need to manually set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable 
specifying the path to Java. To do so:

1. Get the path to Java by running `echo $JAVA_HOME` in the terminal in your pathml conda environment (outside of Jupyter)
2. Set that path as the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in Jupyter:
    ````
    import os
    os.environ["JAVA_HOME"] = "/opt/conda/envs/pathml" # change path as needed
    ````

## Register environment as an IPython kernel
````
conda activate pathml
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pathml
````
This makes the pathml environment available as a kernel in jupyter lab or notebook.
