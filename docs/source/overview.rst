Overview
========

``PathML`` is a toolkit supporting each step in the computational pathology research workflow.

We aim to accelerate research, reduce barriers to entry for new researchers, and promote open science in 
computational pathology.

.. note::
    We provide pre-built tools, public datasets, and documentation to allow anyone with beginner proficiency in Python to
    get started.

For advanced users, we provide a modular set of tools which can be composed into custom workflows, as well as complete
API documentation to enable implementation of new features or tools on top of ``PathML``.
